We propose a new algorithmic framework, dubbed BFGAN, to achieve Lexically Constrained Sentence Generation. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we employ a backward generator and a forward generator to generate lexically constrained sentences together, and use a discriminator to guide the joint training of two generators by assigning them reward signals.
 
**We will release the code and data upon acceptance.**
